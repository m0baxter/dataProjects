# Song Year Data

The data for this project can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/YearPredictionMSD). The aim is to build a regression model that will predict the year a song was released. This project was also an opportunity to use [Bayesian optimization](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization/blob/master/README.md) to tune the hyper parameters of a model.
